Measured each analog input a 0.5V increments. Multimeter had 0.001 precision or better.
Ref Volt: 4.9386 V, measured at 5VA test point.

2022-10-30 Notes from calibrating the test fixtures ADCs:
Measured each analog input a 0.5V increments. Multimeter had 0.001 precision below 7V, 0.01V precision at/above 7.00V
4.936V should be 0x0FFF (4095), The voltage divide on the input is 11k over 10k, so the max input is 10.37V
So there's 10.37V/4095 = 2.53mV/bit (ideal).
